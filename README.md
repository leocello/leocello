### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a skilled and experienced full-stack software engineer with experience in multi-tenancy online systems, API development, and overall web-based software creation. Passionate for solving puzzles and challenging problems, and in constant learning and improving, always trying to make my work better not only from a performance perspective but also for good readability, code quality and future maintenance.
