### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a skilled and experienced lead full stack software engineer with years of experience in SaaS, multi-tenancy systems, API development, and overall software engineering.  

Learning is a passion that makes me improve all the time and to never feel comfortable with the achieved knowledge, very adaptable with different environments and technologies, also with a great capability of mentoring and extracting the best of my team members.  

And I have to admit that I have a special love for solving puzzling and challenging problems.
